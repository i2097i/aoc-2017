### AOC-2017
These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/). I have not hooked up a server component so really all you need to do is clone the repo and open index.html in your browser.

If you want to change it to your solutuons use ```puzzle_inputs.js``` and replace the values for each day.

Feel free to get some pull requests in with more answers!
